# Calorie Deficit Calculator

This is a simple web-based application that calculates the ideal daily calorie intake needed to lose 1 pound per week based on the user's weight. The application uses basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to perform the calculation and display the result to the user.

## Features

User Input: Users enter their weight in pounds.
Calorie Deficit Calculation: The app calculates the user's Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) using a simplified formula and assumes a sedentary activity level.
Weight Loss Goal: It subtracts 500 calories per day from the user's estimated daily calorie needs to help them achieve a 1-pound per week weight loss.
Responsive Design: The app is built with basic CSS and is responsive to different screen sizes.
Formula
The application calculates the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) using a simplified formula:

makefile
Copy code
BMR = 10 \* weight (in kg)
To convert the weight from pounds to kilograms, the following conversion is used:

java
Copy code
weight in kg = weight in pounds \* 0.453592
The BMR is multiplied by 1.2 (assuming a sedentary lifestyle). To create a calorie deficit of 500 calories per day, the final formula is:

java
Copy code
Ideal Daily Calories = (BMR \* 1.2) - 500
How to Use
Input: Enter your weight in the input field provided.
Calculate: Click the "Calculate Daily Calories" button.
Result: The app will display your ideal daily calorie intake to lose 1 pound per week.
